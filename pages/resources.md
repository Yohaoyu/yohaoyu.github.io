#### Computing and Software

- Computing Resources
  - [Hyak](https://itconnect.uw.edu/guides-by-topic/research/hpc/research-computing-services/), the UW’s supercomputer, has had a powerful impact on supporting research at the UW. 
  - [Research Computing Club](http://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/) is a free source for students, funded by the STF at the University of Washington, to use the Hyak computing, and cloud services (Azure, AWS, etc.) resources through the [Cloud Credit Program](http://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/getting-started-2/cloud-computing/). 
  - The [Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE)](https://csde.washington.edu/computing/) also provides computing resources.
  - The [College of Built Environment](https://be.uw.edu/spaces/computing/hyak-resources/) also has one node of Hyak for CBE faculty and students.
  - You can get access to CBE [remote computers and web servers](https://be.uw.edu/spaces/computing/software-application-server/) as students. 

- Techniques and Software
  - Within the UW campus, use the [Wi-Fi services](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/networks-connectivity/uw-networks/campus-wi-fi/) and connect [eduroam](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/networks-connectivity/uw-networks/campus-wi-fi/#visitors) for Internet connection anywhere. 
  - The Student Technology Loan Program allows you to borrow equipment such as laptops, cameras, and projections.
  - UW provides [students with software](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/software-computers/uware/) such as Matlab, Overleaf, SPSS, and ArcGIS. The university or the college does not provide Adobe Suite, but you can use university computers or [buy a student license](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html?sdid=1NZGDDHQ&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAjwyo60BhBiEiwAHmVLJYQrK87O3t6Hu8GvUxY5wAepgO8nyoRw0ggWt5cfY7dx-2HCW4pzdBoCfykQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!692228257657!e!!g!!adobe student&mv=search&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwyo60BhBiEiwAHmVLJYQrK87O3t6Hu8GvUxY5wAepgO8nyoRw0ggWt5cfY7dx-2HCW4pzdBoCfykQAvD_BwE). 
  - UW provides [Husky OnNet, VPN services](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/networks-connectivity/husky-onnet/) for your travel outside of the campus. 

- Printing and Plotting
  - UW Libraries have [printing services](https://www.lib.washington.edu/services/computers) in multiple places across the campus. 
  - CBE Digital Common has [plotting and printing services](https://be.uw.edu/spaces/computing/digital-commons/). 
  - Architectural Hall also has a [plotting service that technically runs 24/7 by ](https://be.uw.edu/spaces/computing/archnet/)self-service. However, you will need the staff to load money to Archnet to do self-service printing.
