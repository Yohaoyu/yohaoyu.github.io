We suggest, as doctoral students, taking whatever courses you are interested in with an objective beyond GPA. Ultimately, your time in graduate school will be assessed not by your grades but by your research performance and impact. You could explore some course registration strategies: 

**Audit a class:** if you don't want to do the homework: you just need to send an email and change to audit ([instruction](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/)).

**Grade options**: a great option (C/NC) if you'd like to attend some hard classes but do not want to influence your GPA.

**Time conflicts**: send an email to the registration office if the conflict is less than an hour per week ([instruction](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/)), need professors' permission if the conflict is more than one hour per week.

**Register for other-major-only courses** See their own website or ask the instructors. For Allen School (CSE), to complete the petition for both undergraduate and graduate level classes ([instruction](https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/ugrad/non-major-registration)).

**Where can I find the syllabus?** Google it with codes and names. All URBDP course syllabi can be found here: [MUP Courses + Syllabi](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/udp-course-listings-and-syllabi/).

#### Master of Urban Planning at UW (Urban Analytics Track)

Currently, *Urban Analytics* or similar data science directions are not formal specializations in the MUP program at UW but students can apply for the [individualized specialization](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/programs/mup-graduate-degree/specializations/) and benefit from one of the best data science universities on the earth. If you prefer to do so, I highly recommend you review basic calculus, probability, linear algebra, and programming before the beginning of the first year. Here is the example curriculum for the urban analytics track. BTW, you can move some required courses to the second year to balance your workload.
